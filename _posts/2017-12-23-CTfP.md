# Bartosz Milewski - Category Theory for Programmers

Bartosz started his excellent series of blogs in October 2014 and put Videos of corresponding lessons for part I and II on Youtube.

I completed part I (blog and videos) and selected ones from part II, but did not manage yet to finish the whole series.

I hope to change this.

I plan to at least finish part I between the years and hope to complete the series in Q1, maybe Q2 2018.

To keep on track and force myself not just to consume the contents, I will give progress reports on this blog.


## Introduction

- Abstraction
- Compoosition
- Identity

Abstraction means to get rid of unnecessary complexity; then (some) formerly different things become identical.
Composition and Identity define Category Theory. This is all there is in Category Theory.

A Category consists of Objects and Morphisms (aka Arrows). An Arrow has a beginning and an end. Objects are just there to mark/name the ends of Arrows.
These are the primitives/atoms of Category Theory; they have now internal structure.

Now to composition: To be a Category, we have further 'Eigenschaften'.

Objects and Arrows do not have structure / information. All the information is contained in how composition works in a specific category. If we have the same objects and arrows, but different composition, we have two different categories.
